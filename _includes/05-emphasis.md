I'm looking to get started in the programming world, right now in my mind I have two paths I can follow: either use programming as a **tool** to assist me in the academic world, or start creating a **journey** for myself as a programmer.
In the next few months I will explore *both* paths and eventually will decide on *which one* makes more sense for me at the time.
